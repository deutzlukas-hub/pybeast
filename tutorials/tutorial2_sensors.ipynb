    "# PyBeast Tuorial 2: Adding Sensors to Agents \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use sensors in BEAST to enable agents to autonomously interact with their environment. By default, any agent that inherits from the `core.agents.animat.Animat` can be equipped with sensors. BEAST provides a variety of predefined sensors that can be instantiated using the functions provided in the `core.sensors.sensor` module. User can create their own customized sensors by inherting from the ```core.sensors.sensorbase.Sensor``` base class. \n",
    "\n",
    "In BEAST, sensors are type sensitive, i.e. they only detect agents or objects of a desired type. Specifically, the `Sensor` class has a `MatchFunc` attribute, a callable responsible for type checking.  Whenever an agent or object of the desired type is detected, the ```Sensor.EvalFunc``` is called, which updates the sensor's internal state. At any time, a sensor's output can be retrieved using the ```Sensor.GetOutput``` method. The sensor's output is filtered by the ```Sensor.ScalFunc``` attribute, which is a callable that scales the output to a desired value range, typically from -1 to 1.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Two useful sensors available in BEAST are the proximity sensor and the nearest angle sensor. You will use these sensors to create two simple experiments featuring autonomously behaving agents. "

The scope of each sensor is set to $\\pi/4$ (45 degrees), and the range is set to 200. Note that sensor range should be defined relative to the world's dimensions, which bey defauly are 800 width and 600 height.

    "The output of both sensors is currently zero because they have not detected anything yet. To test the sensors, we need to create a simulation environment and add instances of the `BraitenbergVehicle` to its world. To control the movement of these vehicles during the simulation, we must implement the vehicle's `Control` method as discussed in the previous tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable the `BraitenbergVehicle` to respond autonomously to other Braitenberg vehicles, we need to adjust the values in its `controls` dictionary based on the sensor outputs. To demonstrate this, we have implemented a simple control method within `BraitenbergVehicle.Control`. First, we retrieve the outputs of the left and right proximity sensors using their `GetOutput` method. By default, the ProximitySensor measures the distance to the nearest object within its detection scope and range and that matches the desired type. It then linearly scales this distance to a value between 1.0 and 0.0, i.e. closer object yield higher outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "If both sensor outputs are zero, indicating no vehicles were detected within range, the vehicleâ€™s left and right control values are set to 1.0, causing the vehicle to move in a straight line at maximum speed. However, if either sensor detects a vehicle (indicated by a non-zero output), the corresponding control values are decreased. Can you guess what behavior this will produce? Let's create a simulation with multiple Braitenberg vehicles to test our hypothesis."
