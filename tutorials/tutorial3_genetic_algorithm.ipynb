    "# PyBeast Tutorial 3: Evolving agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutoral, you will learn how to use a genetic algorithm in BEAST to train agents to preform tasks. A genetic algorithm (GA) is a method for solving optimization problems based on natural selection processes that mimics biological evolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively train a population of agents, we need to define a performance metric which allows us to compare the performance of different agents. The performance metric is commonly referred to as the agent's fitness. Recall that in BEAST, simulations consist of runs, generations and assessments . After each generation, the genetic algorithm randomly selects pairs of individuals called parents. Agents that achieve higher fitness scores during the assessments will be selected with a higher probability. Once a pair of parents is selected, the genetic algorithm combines their genomes to generate a new pair of agents referred to as children. This combination process involves random crossovers and mutations of the parent genomes which will be explained later. Typcially, the GA generates as many children as there were agents in the parent generation, i.e. it conserves the number of agents in the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might wonder what do mean by \"genome\"? Typically, the genome of an agent is a list of hyperparameters that determine the control logic of an agent and, therby, how it responds to its environment. The GA aims to find optimal values for these hyperparameters that maximize the agent's fitness. To design an evovable agent in BEAST, the user must specify the list of hyperparameters that constiute its genome. This should be done by inherting from the `core.evolver.Evolver` class and implementing the `Evolver.GetGenotype` and `Evolver.SetGenotype` methods.   \n",
    "\n",
    "BEAST predefines several evovable agents, which can be found in the `core.agents.neuralanimat` module. The agent classes in the ```neuralanimat``` module implement a neural network, referred to as the agent's brain, that controls the agent's behaviour. To be more precise, the neural network takes the outputs of the agent's sensor as input and generates a vector-valued output. This output vector can then be used as the agent's control values. For instance, in case of a Braitenberg vehicle, two control values are required to actuate the vehicle's left and right wheel. You can refer to the first tutorial for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output values generated by the agent's brain (neural network) for a given sensor input will depend on the network's weights and biases. Hence, BEAST defines the agent's genome as the list of all the weights biases that constitute the agent's brain. This means that the genetic aglorithm aims to optimize the connection's in the agent's brain to the achieve optimal control for a given task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how we can use the concepts we have discussed so far in a simple example. We use the ```Mouse``` class from the previous tutorial as a template and make it evovable. Our goal is to use a GA to train a population of mice to efficiently locate the cheese in its environment.      "

    "In the constructor `EvoMouseSimulation.__init__`, we set the number runs, generations per run, and timeSteps and instantiate an instance of the `core.evolve.geneticalgorithm.GeneticAlgorithm` class, specifying the crossover probability, mutation probability and selection method of the GA. The class `GeneticAlgorithm` supports three selection methods: roulette, rank, and tournament. Here, is a brief overwiew of each: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Roulette selection: An agent's selection probability is calculated based on its fitness score   \n",
    "- Rank selection: An agent's selection probability is determined by its rank which is determined by it relative fitness.  \n",
    "- Tournament selection: Agents are randomly selected, but chooses the fittest among the selected agents is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the genetic algorithm has selected two parent agents, their is a crossover probability chance that their genomes will be crossed over. After the crossover, each gene (hyperparameter) has a mutation probability chance to be mutated (changed in value). By default, the gentic agorithm uses Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard devivation 0.2. Note that the size of variations introduced by the mutations need to be of a simlar range as the hyperparameters. In our example, weight and biases are initialized within the range -1.0 and 1.0, i.e. a standard deviation of 0.2 is a reasonable choice. `GeneticAlgorithm` has additional parameters that control the selection and generation process of the next generation. Have a look at the source code to find more information. \n",

    "To add a evovable population of `EvoMouse` agents to our simulation, we first create an instance of the `core.evolve.population.Population`, specifying the population size, agent type, and pass a reference to the `GeneticAlgorithm` instance. `Population` implements the ```EndGeneration``` method which will called at the end of each generation and takes care of evolving the agents and creating the next generation. Similar to groups, populations can be added to the simulation using the `Simulation.Add` method. To analyse how well the mice learn their task, we create data structures and store the average fitness of each generation during the seperate runs. Let's run and render the simulation to see how it looks like"
